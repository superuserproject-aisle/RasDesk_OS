# RasDesk OS
******************** ISSUES FIXED. SEE BELOW. ********************

The ideal operating system for using your Raspberry Pi as a desktop computer

This operating system is based on Raspberry Pi OS 3.6 and has things preinstalled for your use. You can even run 32 bit Windows apps with this operating system. I installed LibreOffice for office work, Pinta as a paint program, The Nemo file manager, Pi Apps & Snap Store for more apps, and much more.
I also changed some settings on the interface like adding a new skin and wallpaper. There is a screenshot of the desktop above.

I hope you enjoy this operating system!
