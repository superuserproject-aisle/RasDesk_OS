# RasDesk OS
The ideal operating system for using your Raspberry Pi as a desktop

This operating system is based on Raspberry Pi OS and has things preinstalled for your use. You can even run 32 bit Windows apps with this operating system. I installed LibreOffice for office work, Pinta as a paint program, The Nemo file manager, Pi Apps and Snap Store for getting more apps, and much more.
I also changed some settings on the interface like adding a new skin and wallpaper.

I hope you enjoy this operating system
